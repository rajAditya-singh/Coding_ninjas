    <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
    <p>
      Normally, a great code has three common features:
      <strong>maintainability, dependability, and usability</strong>. It should
      also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing environments.
    </p>

    <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
    <p>
        <b>This is easily the most important step of all. In the absence of these,
        a code may be inefficient even if it is completed.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>COMMENTING</h3>
    <p>
        <em><u>Comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer</u>. Name of the
        module, purpose of the module, description of the module, original
        author, modifications <del>and authors who modified code with a description on why it was
        modified were components of an early commenting practice</del>.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often,
        developers use Y<sub>1</sub>or X<sub>1</sub> as variables, and then do
        not replace them with meaningful names.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h3>
    <p>
        <em>To achieve a certain result, developers may use complex logic but this should be
        minimised while writing a good code. An added advantage is if the code is also suitably
        <sup>compact</sup>.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>PORTABILITY</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Another feature of a good code is <u>portability</u>.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>TESTING</h3>
    <p>
        <em><del>Testing</del> is also a necessary part in the process of coding.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h3>
    <p>
        <em>While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout.</em>
