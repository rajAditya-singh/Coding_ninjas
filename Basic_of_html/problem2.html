        Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming
    </h1>

    <p>
        Just like with any other activity, the world of coding is also governed by
        informal rules.
    </p>

    <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>

            <h3><b>COMMENTING</b></h3>
            <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><b>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</b></h3>
            <p>Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often developers use Y1 or X1 as variables, and then do not replace them with meaningful names.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3><b>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</b></h3>
            <p>The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain result, developers may use complex logic but this should be minimised while writing a good code.</p>
